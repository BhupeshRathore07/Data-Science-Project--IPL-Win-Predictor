# IPL-Win-Predictor
Over the period of decade, the craze of cricket and IPL in India has exponentially increased. As a Data science enthusiast, working on data of IPL is always fun.
Today I’m creating end-to-end project, where after submitting the target score with some required fields, the model predicts the chance for batting team whether they will achieve the target or not and the output is shown in percentage after calculating the probabilities using Logistic Regression.

## Data Set

Data is obtained from Kaggle as IPL Data Set, 2008 - 2021. Link for the Data set is : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vora1011/ipl-2008-to-2021-all-match-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vora1011/ipl-2008-to-2021-all-match-dataset) .
This data set contains two csv (‘comma separated values’) files, where one file gives the details for every match played in IPL with details like winning team, loosing team, venue, toss, total runs scored, date, league stage, and even more. While other csv file gives ball-by-ball details of each and every match where, columns like innings, ball_number, total_run, etc. are useful.

## Preprocessing the data
